For the final project I was supposed to create a database application that demonstrates how to perform CRUD operations on a database. The application Iâ€™ve created is named  The Montana Event Coordination System. It can be used to oversee event details within Montana. These events imply a variety of performances, conferences, and athletic competitions in various arenas, concert venues, and stadiums. This system records and provides information about Montana-area events, including their respective categories and venues, to users.
